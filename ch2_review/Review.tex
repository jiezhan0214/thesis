\chapter{Energy-Harvesting Intermittent Systems} \label{chapter:review}

The development of energy harvesters and low power electronics provides the potential for wireless IoT sensors to operate with power autonomy, with their designs adapted to variable harvested power rather than reliable power supply~\cite{miorandi2012internet}. 
This chapter first provides a background of various ambient energy sources and their corresponding energy harvesters in \sref{sec:eh}, as well as the types of energy storage used in energy-harvesting systems in \sref{sec:es}. 
Energy-neutral operation, a traditional design of energy-harvesting systems, is introduced in \sref{sec:en}. 
The recent research towards IPSs is then reviewed in \sref{sec:ips} with a classification of proposed IPS methodologies.
Finally, \sref{sec:ch2_summary} summarises this chapter.
