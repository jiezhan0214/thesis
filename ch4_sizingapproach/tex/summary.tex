\section{Summary} \label{sec:c4_summary}

This chapter has presented an approach for sizing energy storage when deploying IPSs, trading off forward progress against capacitor volume and interruption periods. 
The work includes a simulation tool which is available to download, enabling researchers to experiment with energy storage sizes to optimise IPS designs. 
The approach was configured and demonstrated with an experimentally-profiled IPS and real-world data of PV sources, showing up to a 43\% annual forward progress gain by sizing energy storage. 
A cost function can be incorporated, allowing various properties of the system to be traded-off. 
The results showed that the suggested energy storage capacitance achieves \SI{93}{\percent} of the maximum forward progress while saving \SI{83}{\percent} capacitor volume and \SI{91}{\percent} interruption periods. 
Our conclusion is that energy storage should be carefully designed, rather than minimised or indiscriminately picked, to efficiently operate IPSs.
