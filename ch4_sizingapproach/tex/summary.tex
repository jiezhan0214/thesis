\section{Summary} \label{sec:c4_summary}

While conventional IPSs have used minimal levels of capacitance, this paper has shown that increasing the amount of energy storage can improve forward progress by up to 65\% with a constant current supply and 43\% with real-world PV sources. The work includes a simulation tool which is available to download, enabling researchers to experiment with energy storage sizes to optimize IPS designs. A cost function can be incorporated, allowing various properties of the system to be traded-off. Our conclusion is that energy storage should be carefully designed, rather than minimized or indiscriminately picked, to efficiently operate IPSs. Future work will include a further investigation into cost functions for meeting multiple design objectives, and extensions to the simulation tool, e.g. models of additional energy storage devices and peripheral workloads.
