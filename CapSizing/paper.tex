%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.

%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat

% background, knowledge, facts
Batteryless energy-harvesting devices promise to deliver a sustainable Internet of Things. Intermittent computing is an emerging area, where forward progress of application execution is maintained by saving volatile computing state into non-volatile memory before power interruptions, and restored afterwards. Conventional intermittent computing approaches typically minimize energy storage to reduce device dimensions and interruption periods, 
% , e.g. a decoupling capacitor, which is just enough for the most energy-expensive atomic operation. 
but this can result in high state-saving and -restoring overheads and impede forward progress. 
% whereas increasing energy storage increases physical dimensions and interruption periods. 
% though improves forward progress. 
% To evaluate forward progress of such systems in deployment requires considerations on energy source variability and understanding of intermittent computing. 
% Argument
In this paper, we argue that adding a small amount of energy storage can significantly improve forward progress. 
% work, solution
%For fast exploration, we propose a model-based approach for identifying an appropriate energy storage capacitance which trades off forward progress, dimensions, and interruption periods. 
% \color{red}(Sth about being hard to model) \color{black}
We develop an intermittent computing model that accurately estimates forward progress, with an experimentally validated mean error of 0.5\%. 
Using this model, we show that sizing energy storage can improve forward progress by up to 65\% with a constant current supply, and 43\% with real-world photovoltaic sources. 
% with xx\% reduction on state-saving and -restoring overheads. 
% The experimental results also show that a suggested \SI{43}{\micro\farad} capacitor improves forward progress by up to \SI{30.4}{\percent} compared an on-board \SI{10}{\micro\farad} one. 
An extension to this approach, which uses a cost function to trade off the energy storage size against forward progress, can save 83\% of capacitor volume and 91\% of interruption periods while maintaining 93\% of the maximum forward progress.
% Finally, we propose an alternative sizing approach which uses a cost function, achieving \SI{93}{\percent} of maximum forward progress while saving \SI{83}{\percent} of capacitor volume and \SI{91}{\percent}of interruption periods \color{blue} compared to the aforementioned size\color{black}.

% Old Abstract 
% Forward progress in battery-less devices powered by intermittent energy harvesting sources is maintained by intermittent computing, where volatile computing state is saved into and restored from non-volatile memory before and after power interruptions. To reduce device dimensions and start-up time, energy storage, e.g. a capacitor, in such systems is minimized to a level which is just enough for the most energy-expensive atomic operation. In this paper, however, we show that energy storage capacitance beyond the minimum leads to forward progress improvement by reducing state saving and restoring overheads, but compromises storage dimensions and start-up time. To illustrate this trade-off, we formulate the relationship between forward progress and energy storage capacitance given different power supply levels. Based on this relationship and an intermittent computing model framework, we explore the design space of energy storage and energy harvester with respect to forward progress, start-up time, and device dimensions. We further propose a method of sizing energy storage and energy harvester for energy harvesting devices in real-world deployment, which balances forward progress and device dimensions. We validate our formulation and model via experiments based on an MSP430FR6989 microcontroller, where the results show that increasing storage capacitance from xx\textmu F to xx\textmu F forward progress by xx-xx\% with xx-xx\% reduction of state saving and restoring overheads, while the storage volume increase by 0-xx\% for various off-the-shelf capacitors. The suggested energy storage capacitance of our sizing method increases forward progress by xx\% and xx\% for solar and RF energy sources respectively.

\section{Conclusions} \label{section:conclusion}

% We explored the relationship between forward progress and energy storage capacitance in intermittent computing through a theoretical model.

% In this paper, we presented a model of reactive ICSs that accurately estimates forward progress. 
% Using this model, we explored the sizing effect of energy storage on forward progress with respect to supply current and volatile state size, showing up to \SI{64.9}{\percent} progress improvement under constant current supply and \SIrange{7.8}{43.3}{\percent} improvement on annual mean forward progress 
% under various real-world energy conditions. 

While conventional ICSs have used minimal levels of capacitance, this paper has shown that increasing the amount of energy storage can improve system performance by up to 65\% with a constant current supply and 43\% with real-world PV sources. The work includes a simulation tool which is available to download, enabling researchers to experiment with energy storage sizes to optimize ICS designs. A cost function can be incorporated, allowing various aspects of system performance to be traded-off. Our conclusion is that energy storage should be carefully designed, rather than minimized or indiscriminately picked, to efficiently operate ICSs.
%\color{blue}
%\todo{Alex to update this after other parts completed/queries resolved.}In this paper, we explored the energy storage sizing effect on ICS forward progress, concluding that adding a relatively small amount of energy storage can significantly improve forward progress. 
%We proposed an approach for sizing energy storage, which improves forward progress with insignificant overheads on capacitor volume and interruption periods. 
% We integrated the model into a PV-based ICS framework to demonstrate the sizing approach, where results show that the suggested energy storage capacitance achieves \SI{98.3}{\percent} of the maximum forward progress while saving \SI{71.7}{\percent} capacitor volume and \SI{83.8}{\percent} interruption periods. 
% We validated the reactive intermittent computing model, which demonstrates only \SI{0.5}{\percent} mean absolute percentage error on forward progress compared to the experimentally measured values.
% Experimental results also showed that a reasonably sized \SI{43}{\micro\farad} capacitor improves forward progress by up to \SI{55.2}{\percent} and \SI{30.4}{\percent} compared to a theoretical minimum \SI{6.2}{\micro\farad} one and an on-board \SI{10}{\micro\farad} one across various levels of supply current. 
%We believe that the problem of frequent power interruptions in energy-harvesting supply can be easily alleviated by using an appropriately-sized capacitor. 
% Instead, the design of energy storage plays a significant role in practical deployment.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.

% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will

% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
